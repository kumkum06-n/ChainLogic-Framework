# ChainLogic Framework

## 📌 Project Title
**ChainLogic Framework — A Minimalistic Logic Execution System Using Blockchain**

## 📄 Project Description
ChainLogic Framework is a lightweight decentralized system built on Solidity to store, execute, and track logical tasks on the Ethereum blockchain.  
The framework allows users to add tasks, complete them, and retrieve their current state, providing transparency and immutability.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a modular, blockchain-powered logic execution framework that enables developers and organizations to automate workflows and store verifiable logic states securely on-chain.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Task Creation:** Users can create logical tasks stored immutably on the blockchain.  
- **Task State Management:** Tasks can be marked as completed, ensuring tamper-proof state transitions.  
- **On-Chain Data Retrieval:** Public access to task details ensures transparency.  
- **Lightweight & Expandable:** Designed as a starter framework for building more advanced logic engines.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Multi-user role management (Admin, Developer, Executor)  
- Event logging for real-time monitoring  
- Integration with off-chain computation (Chainlink Functions)  
- Gas optimization for bulk task execution  
- Frontend dashboard for visualization  
- Support for modular plugins to extend logic behavior
